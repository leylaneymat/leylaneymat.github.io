                    <p>We are very glad that we can learn how to make sites from the beginning of our journey. It was quite
                        interesting and productive to learn about HTML, CSS and JS. Luckily, most of us didn't have problems in
                        completing the courses that were related to these languages. You can view our progress through our accounts.</p>
